## Outline

#### 01. Basics <br>
- Start by understanding what code/coding is and why you want to learn it. Explore different programming languages and their applications to find one that suits your goals. It is highly recommended to start with Python if you are unsure.

#### 02. Environment <br>
- Install the necessary tools and software for coding, including a text editor. VSCodium is a recommended place to start. Other options include Emacs and Vim.

#### 03. "Hello, World!" <br>
- Begin with the classic "Hello, World!" program. This simple program is usually the first thing you write in any language and helps you understand the basic syntax.

#### 04. Fundamentals <br>
- Variables: Learn how to declare and use variables to store data.
- Data Types: Understand different data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
- Operators: Explore arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
- Control Structures: Conditionals (if statements) and Loops (for, while).

#### 05. Functions and Methods <br>
- Understand how to create functions (or methods in object-oriented programming). Learn about parameters, return values, and the importance of code reusability.

#### 06. Data Structures <br>
Understand how to manipulate and iterate through the following:
- Lists
- Arrays
- Dictionaries
- Sets

#### 07. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) <br>
- If you're learning a language that supports OOP (e.g., Python, Java, C++), grasp the concepts of classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

#### 08. Error Handling <br>
- Learn how to handle errors and exceptions in your code gracefully.

#### 09. File Handling <br>
- Understand how to read from and write to files. This is essential for working with data.

#### 10. Libraries and Frameworks <br>
- Explore libraries and frameworks related to your chosen programming language. For Python, you might learn about NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, or Django, depending on your interests.

#### 11. Version Control <br>
- Familiarize yourself with version control systems like Git. This is crucial for collaborating on projects and managing code changes.

#### 12. Practice Projects <br>
- Start working on small projects to apply what you've learned. These can be simple scripts or mini-apps that solve practical problems.

#### 13. Online Courses and Tutorials <br>
- Enroll in online coding courses or follow tutorials to deepen your understanding of specific topics.

#### 14. Problem Solving and Algorithms <br>
- Study algorithms and data structures. Practice solving coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal.

#### 15. Advanced Topics <br>
- Depending on your goals, delve into advanced topics such as web development, mobile app development, machine learning, or game development.

#### 16. Real-World Projects <br>
- As you gain confidence, start building larger and more complex projects that showcase your skills.

#### 17. Collaboration and Open Source <br>
- Consider contributing to open-source projects or collaborating with others to gain practical experience and learn from experienced developers.

#### 18. Continuously Learn and Stay Updated <br>
- Technology evolves rapidly, so make a habit of staying updated with the latest developments in your chosen programming language and field of interest.

> *“If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It could mean mockery--isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is.”* <br>
